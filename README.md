# RLGYG
This is a small python script which makes sure Gif Your Game is only running while Rocket League is open (Conserving valuable CPU performance in other games / regular desktop use)


If you want to have this script run on windows startup, follow these steps:

1: Hold down windows key + R to open run menu.

2: Type "shell:startup" without quotes into the text box, end press enter.

3: Place either RLGYG.py or RLGYG.pyw (whichever you prefer) into the folder that comes up (any file you place in this folder will run automatically on windows startup).

4: Done!

!!!

RLGYG.py will exit when you close the console, but since RLGYG.pyw doesn't use a console, to exit it you will need to close python in the task manager.

!!!

I recommend you use RLGYG.pyw most of the time, and only use RLGYG.py if you experience issues.
