# RLGYG
This is a small python script which makes sure Gif Your Game is only running while Rocket League is open


If you want to have this script run on windows startup, follow these steps:

1: Hold down windows key + R to open run menu.

2: Type "shell:startup" without quotes into the text box, end press enter.

3: Place either RLGYG.py or RLGYG.pyw (whichever you prefer) into the folder that comes up (any file you place in this folder will run automatically on windows startup).

4: Done!

!!!

RLGYG.py will exit when you close the console, but since RLGYG.pyw doesn't use a console, to exit it you will need to end the task in the task manager.
